-- Hello everyone! This is my little weapon collection.
-- I hope you guys like what is included in this collection.
-- There are 8 weapons included in this collection.
-- 5 Staffs, 2 Hammers and a double handed Sword.

-- 1. The first one is the Sword, called "Father's Sword". It is a double handed Sword.
-- 2. The second one is called "Sulfuras, hand of Ragnaros" and it is a Replica of the same-named weapon from World of Warcraft.
-- 3. The Third weapon is my impression of an "Elder Staff". A Staff wielded by the oldest and most powerful wizzards in the whole world.
-- 4. The fourth weapon is a Steampunk inspired Staff which focusses the magical Energy and shoot's electrobolt-styled Projectiles.
-- 5. The fifth weapon in this collection is a Fairy-style/Sci-Fi Stylish Staff with a powerfull Magic cube on it's top.
-- 6. The Sixth weapon is the "Staff of the Forest" and it contains the power of the nature in it. 
-- 7. The seventh weapon is the Staff of the Monastery. This weapon focusses the Holy Power in your Body and gives you the ability to aim this power at your enemies.
-- 8. The last weapon in this collection is a Steampunk inspired Hammer. This Hammer gives you the Power to crush your Enemies.
