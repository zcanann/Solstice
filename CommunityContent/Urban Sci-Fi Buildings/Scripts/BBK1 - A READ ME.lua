Urban Scifi Buildings
Background Building Kit 1 (BBK1)

XRStudio: Nya Alchemi, Chaz Scholton
		
This is a collection of building, which are designed to be
"large environmental props".  These building are exterior models
without any interiors.  

The theme of this kit was original designed for "Cyberpunk", with
styles ranging from Urban to Science Fiction.  

	
This kit is broken down into four theme categories.
----------------------------------------------
* Neon Urban 
* Scifi
* SciFi Urban
* Urban
----------------------------------------------

** Neon Ubran
These building are Urban style designed buildings with a touch of
Neon elements added to.  Perfect for any Noir Environment.

* Scifi ///
These are mostly experimental builds 

* SciFi Urban
Experimental Scifi themed Urban style buildings

* Urban
These are Urban buildings without the Neon.  This is alternative
to the Neon Urban theme collection.

-----------------------------------------------
MESH MERGE
-----------------------------------------------
All these props have been optimized using Mesh Merge. Some folders
or assets inside the props should not be Merged.  There are
"no merge", "do not merge" comments contained inside.

There are some Materials which have issues with Mesh Merge at
the time of this Kit's release. 

Also Lua scripting does not work on Merged objects.

-----------------------------------------------
Other comments
-----------------------------------------------
A lot of work went into this kit. If you encounter
any issues or problems.
